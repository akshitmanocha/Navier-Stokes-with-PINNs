# Solving Navier-Stokes Equation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This project uses a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equation, which models fluid flow. The solution leverages PyTorch to create and train a neural network that incorporates physical laws into its architecture, allowing it to predict solutions to differential equations without requiring labeled data.
